What is Cultima?
An open world RPG in tribute to the Ultima series:
-randomly generated world and terrain
-procedurally random generated locations
-randomly generated names, characters with over 100 different player, NPC and monster types
-randomly generated music that reacts dynamically to the events in game
-randomly guided weather and events that can alter the world (wind, rain, fog, snow, rainbows, tornados, lightning, forest-fires, etc)
-randomly generated missions with over 60 mission type templates
-50 achievements with in-game achievement tracking
-dynamic NPC spawns that depend on season, weather, time and location
-game manual (journal) and dynamic map that build as you discover information about the game
-experience the fantasy bronze-age dynamics of morality, stealth, training, hunting, crafting, mining, puzzles, marriage, divorce, real estate, pets, sailing, warfare, death, and taxes

Disclaimer:  since the terrain and character/place names are randomly generated, 
they will on occasion take the form of something provocative or obscene.
Any resemblance to shapes or words that cause offense are completely coincidental and a result of unlucky randomness.

On magic:
Magic can be crafted in 4 forms:
General spells can be learned from a book and remembered to be called whenever the player has enough manna
     - Some general spells have an instant effect, while others last over a duration of time
Directed and aimed spells (mostly combative) require a staff to be learned and wielded
     - Once a player buys a magic staff, they are bound to it and can not discard it, therefore taking a weapons slot
Instant magic can be performed by any player by taking certain potions
     - Potions are a one time use, but the player can hold several potions
Many magic items can be found and used by any player, including those with shallow mind skill
     - Their effect is constant while the player has the item

While in conversation with NPCs, single letters will be auto-completed when entered in the green text window.

On morality:
* Reputation guides whether or not characters will talk to you or aid you in the game.
* Reputation is based on what other human characters in the game are witness to:
Good deeds with witness that add to a reputation:
   -giving to the poor or donating to a temple
   -finding lost people in caves or mines
   -rescuing prisoners in dungeons or monster lairs
   -completing non-assassination missions, like retrieving an item, delivering a message, clearing a location of monsters
   -slaying a monster that wanders into a city or village
   -successfully defeating a rival army with a local militia
Wicked deeds with witness that subtract from a reputation:
   -vandalism (breaking down city or castle walls/doors, picking locks, arson)
   -pickpocketing
   -theft of city/town or castle chests
   -abuse of a dog companion or trained horse
   -assault
   -murder
   -getting caught with multiple spouses
   -completing assassination missions (bounty missions given by a king are neutral)
* A particularly infamous or wicked player can gain wealth and experience faster with theft and murder,
but will find less help from others, and if extreme, will even be turned away by shoppekeeps.
* A reputed heroic player will find more guidance from others, such as filling out the player's map with directions to locations, and for legendary players, get discounts on training and shoppe items.
* The witnessed murdering of characters will build a bounty against you, and heighten your chances of assassins seeking your bounty.
* The murdering of particularly noble characters or teachers that you have studied with can anger the gods and result in a curse.
* There are ways by which a wicked character can charm or impress those around them to help when they wouldn't otherwise.

On character roles and learning game mechanics:
All character roles and many game mechanics can be learned by talking to the characters in game.
Most key words that can be followed up in conversation will highlight in blue text.
The main character roles can be discovered by first finding and conversing with a town's barkeep.
Weapon and spell information can be learned from the shoppekeeps of armories and magic shops.
Monster information and strategies for fighting them can be learned from local swordsmen and adventurers.
All important information learned about monsters, weapons, townsfolk, spells, locations and riddles are automatically logged in the player's journal.
Think of the journal as a game manual that builds as you play the game.
Certain character types can have different roles depending on their locations (city, village, castle, temple, hermit's hut, etc).
